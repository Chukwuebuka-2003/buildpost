> Turn your git commits into engaging social media posts using AI

Free CLI tool that transforms your git commits into social media content. Perfect for developers who want to build in public but struggle with content creation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered**: Works with OpenAI or Groq LLMs
- **Multiple Styles**: Casual, professional, technical, learning-focused, and more
- **Platform-Optimized**: Twitter, LinkedIn, Dev.to, and generic formats
- **YAML Templates**: Fully customizable prompt templates
- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install buildpost
```

### Setup

1. Pick your LLM provider:
   - `openai`: GPT-4o mini (default) or any compatible Chat Completions model
   - `groq`: Lightning-fast Qwen3 and Llama-family models

2. Grab an API key:
   - OpenAI: [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Groq: [Groq console](https://console.groq.com/keys)

3. Configure BuildPost:

```bash
buildpost config set-key YOUR_API_KEY           # saves key for the active provider (OpenAI by default)
# Optional: switch providers or customise the default model
buildpost config set-provider groq --model qwen/qwen3-32b
buildpost config set-key --provider groq gsk-XXXX
```

Prefer environment variables?

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key    # or GROQ_API_KEY=...
```

### Usage

Generate a post from your latest commit:

```bash
buildpost
```

That's it! The post will be generated and copied to your clipboard.

## Prompt Styles

### Casual (Default)
Perfect for Twitter and personal brands. Conversational, friendly, uses emojis.

**Example:**
```
Just squashed a tricky auth bug! üêõ

Spent the morning debugging the login flow and finally tracked it down.
Feels good to ship a fix!

#100DaysOfCode #BuildInPublic
```

### Professional
Ideal for LinkedIn. Polished, achievement-focused, no emojis.

**Example:**
```
Improved API performance by implementing a Redis caching layer.

Key improvements:
‚Ä¢ 60% reduction in average response time
‚Ä¢ Decreased database load
‚Ä¢ Better user experience during peak traffic

What caching strategies have worked well for your team?

#SoftwareEngineering #Performance
```

### Technical
Great for Dev.to and Hashnode. Detailed, educational, technical.

**Example:**
```
Migrated our user API from REST to GraphQL

Why we made the switch:
- Reduced over-fetching (clients request only needed fields)
- Single endpoint vs. multiple REST routes
- Better type safety with GraphQL schemas

The refactor took about a week but the DX improvement is worth it.

#GraphQL #APIDesign
```

### Thread Starter
Opens a Twitter thread. Hook-focused and intriguing.

### Achievement
Celebrate milestones and wins. Great for any platform.

### Learning
Share what you learned. Perfect for building in public.

## Platforms

### Twitter/X
- Max 280 characters
- 2-3 hashtags
- Punchy and concise

### LinkedIn
- Up to 3000 characters
- Professional tone
- 2-4 paragraphs
- Ends with a question

### Dev.to / Hashnode
- Technical and detailed
- Educational focus
- Can include code concepts

### Generic
- Balanced format
- Works across platforms
- Moderate length

## Customization

### Creating Custom Prompts

Edit `~/.buildpost/prompts.yaml`:

```yaml
prompts:
  my_custom_style:
    name: "My Custom Style"
    description: "A custom prompt for my needs"
    system: |
      You are a developer with a unique voice...

    template: |
      Based on this commit, create a post:

      Commit: {commit_message}
      Files: {files_changed}

      Make it awesome!
```

Use it:

```bash
buildpost --style my_custom_style
```

### Template Variables

Available variables in templates:

- `{commit_hash}` - Full commit hash
- `{short_hash}` - Short commit hash (7 chars)
- `{commit_message}` - Commit message
- `{author}` - Commit author
- `{date}` - Commit date
- `{files_changed}` - List of changed files
- `{diff_summary}` - Summary of changes
- `{insertions}` - Lines added
- `{deletions}` - Lines deleted
- `{files_count}` - Number of files changed

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Tweet

```bash
$ buildpost
```

```
Just implemented dark mode for the settings page! üåô

Added theme switching with React Context and CSS variables.
The toggle feels so smooth!

#ReactJS #WebDev
```

### Example 2: LinkedIn Post

```bash
$ buildpost --style professional --platform linkedin
```

```
Implemented a comprehensive caching strategy for our API layer.

This optimization resulted in:
‚Ä¢ 65% faster average response times
‚Ä¢ 40% reduction in database queries
‚Ä¢ Improved scalability for concurrent users

The implementation uses Redis for distributed caching with a
smart invalidation strategy based on data mutation events.

impact in your projects?

### Example 3: Technical Blog Post

```bash
$ buildpost --commit abc123 --style technical --platform devto
```

```
Refactored our authentication system to use JWT instead of sessions

Why we made the change:
- Stateless authentication (no server-side session storage)
- Better scalability across multiple servers
- Simpler mobile app integration
- Industry standard with broad library support

The migration was done in phases:
1. Implemented JWT generation alongside existing sessions
2. Migrated frontend to use JWT tokens
3. Deprecated session-based auth after monitoring period

Key learnings: Always implement both systems in parallel during
migration to allow easy rollback.

```

## Troubleshooting

### "No API key found"

Make sure you‚Äôve saved a key for the provider you‚Äôre using:

```bash
buildpost config set-provider openai
buildpost config set-key --provider openai sk-...   # OpenAI key

buildpost config set-provider groq
buildpost config set-key --provider groq gsk-...    # Groq key
```

Environment variable names:

| Provider | Environment variable | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Works with GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 |
| `groq`   | `GROQ_API_KEY`       | Supports Qwen & Llama models |

Set it before running BuildPost:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...
```

### "Not a git repository"

Run BuildPost from within a git repository:

```bash
cd your-git-repo
buildpost
```

### "Invalid commit reference"

Make sure the commit hash exists:

```bash
git log --oneline  # See available commits
buildpost --commit <hash>
```

### Generated post is too long

Try a different platform or style:

```bash
buildpost --platform twitter  # Shorter format
buildpost --style casual       # Usually more concise
```

### API rate limits

Each provider enforces its own rate/usage limits. If you hit them:
- OpenAI: check account limits or switch to a lighter model (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5)
- Groq: review quota in the Groq console or pick a smaller model
- Reduce how frequently you generate posts
